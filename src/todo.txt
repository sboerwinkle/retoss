TODO:
/ Revert platform spawning change so it's less bad
- Rehabilitate shipping.gam (not in git yet)
/ Add "icon" for remaining lobby levels (arena.sav, one other?)
/ Allow /teamselect blocks that don't set color (if value is out of mask, maybe?)
/ Things that are being pushed by things that are being pushed aren't resolved first
/ Server exiting cancels input thread but doesn't exit app
/ Complete switch to Scheme ref-counting
	/ References seem to be resolved, maybe
	/ Next step is actually doing our own allocation and reclaiming
		Is this really, truly done?? Wow
/ Switch to C-land
	/ Scheme is all torn out now, even if it no longer compiles quite...
	/ Get it to run again
/ Movement shouldn't be so wacky - friction should be along a vector towards the destination.
	This would still maintain the "squares come out of spinning and shooting" thing
/ Better color options for players I guess
/ Turn off TCP scheduling heuristic for more real-time communication
/ Name display (maybe just show chat msg over head)
	Abandoned in favor of individual colors b/c I'm lazy
	Later, actually implemented!
/ Predictive state
	/ State cloning operation
! Need to switch the handler-serialization scheme to use compile-time enums instead of string lookup
	Necessary for proper serialization
	/ Jokes on me, turns out you can count without using enums lol
	/ Joke's on me again, at some point I did change to enums lol
/ Velbox (R-trees to handle collisions)
/ Flags explode on contact <3
! User platforms expire?
	! fade to grey near end of life
- Particles on death
	This would be nice for user platforms, but it's actually kinda weird.
	We can't really make them "next tick" since the parent object won't exist
	We could add them in the middle of the tick, but we'd need to properly initialize `old` which could be hard
	Maybe the thing to do is add them to some list to be added at the end of this tick,
		so they aren't used in collisions but they still appear where they are expected to
	The only tricky bit becomes that the parent velbox will probably be removed by that point
		Best solution I can see to this is to just keep it around (until the deads are cleaned)
		and just add a check to ignore dead things in collisions.
		Kinda rough but oh well?
/ User platforms less prone to jank
	! Magic expanding pellet magic
	/ Should also refund player resources if they have to abort
/ Automatic state sync on join
/ Some way to use tools
/ State serizalization
	/ Save to file
	/ Send over wire
	/ dynamic joining
/ "Finish" edit tooling
	/ Bulk selection in area
	/ Flips / rotations on selected items
	/ resizing existing things
		! stretching an edge to a desired point
			This operation can fail since object widths are always even!
	/ Documentation for all this edit stuff dear god
/ Friction as a concept native to the engine?
/ Rework handler registrar again so module load order isn't so closely tied to the handler's ID
	Probably a big header with enums is the way to go here, so handlers have an ID rather than a name
	Could still associate the ID with a name of course
/ more circuit components
	/ delay (timer)
	/ randomizer
/ Magic steppy legs
	These "work" but I think they could be dumber and also more functional
	/ Rework leggs
/ friction configurable
/ Make Escort Cube
/ factory
- soccer 2.0
/ edit thumbtacks disappear in-flight if you clear their buffer
/ no_draw_fp should be independently editable, like weightlessness
/ weightlessness should accept an optional 1/0 arg, to override default toggle behavior
/ Seats should let you set a view distance when active
/ Figure out how the heck vehicles are going to work
	I'd like to make "controls" (except for the clicky bits) go away
		But that makes, like, aiming a vehicle be a whole hassle
		who knows honestly
	So it would need to be more... hands-on somehow
	This would also require a complete rework of how weapons were going to function... hm
		Unless they also only read A/B signals?
		With decor for targeting?
/ Better tools
	I'm thinking tools come in 3 sizes:
		2-H (two handed) tools are like the tools we have now. You can hold one, and it can read either mouse button.
		Pri (primary) tools can only read LMB. You can only hold one, and never with a 2-handed tool.
		Aux tools will be weird.
			They can be in either "hand", and can read either LMB or RMB depending on which hand they're in.
			You can hold two, or one in additon to a Pri tool.
			(None with a 2-handed tool)
			Aux tools will need to display in the HUD differently depending on which hand they're in
	Shift doesn't drop the active tool anymore; shfit+(mouse button) drops the tool in that hand.
		If there's nothing in that hand, any Aux tool in the other hand gets swapped there
			(Aux tools being the only ambidexterous tools)
		In the event you pick up a Primary tool while holding only an LMB Aux tool,
			the Aux tool must be swapped to RMB to make space.
			This should be the only situation where tools change hands automatically.
	Purpose:
		More flexible "builds", but still not a full inventory system
		"better" tools can compensate by being Pri or 2-H
		Complex tools can still use 2 inputs, if they need to, by being 2-H
	Not sure how exactly to track this, when they're both just held objects, but I'll find a way
		Maybe Aux tools just always dedicate their first slider to this.
- config file
	- Regular key binds (WASD Space Shift)
	- Some edit keybinds, like save/load?
	- mouseDragSize
	- maybe configuration for scroll wheel handling, if you've got one of those fancy smooth scroll wheels?
	- left-handed mode for mouse button inputs
	- left-handed mode for Aux tool HUD display
	/ default color, *maybe*
		Haha did this first actually (plus name, host, port)
/ raytrace for camera positioning uses interpolated positions
/ Eye box positioning uses velocity setting, not teleportation, so it interpolates
/ Fix graphical lag, or whatever that is
- See if a dedicated allocator besides `malloc` makes a measurable difference?
/ Nametags
/ Document /name command
/ Unsafe memory access when deserializing wires
/ Stop being so stingy with frame data (don't enforce equal lag, so everybody gets less lag on average)
/ Document /adjust
- HOLD_SINGLE is defunct, remove it

- CTF scoring plz

/ Editing HUD shows number of items in blue/red buffer, as dots above/below crosshair
- Optional max score for scoreboard

- Optimizations
	- Can some parts of velbox be multi-threaded? Thinking divide the pool of aunts to check among multiple threads.
	- For the cost of one more frame of latency, we can double how long we have to foward-simulate
		Not sure if this should be activated dynamically on the client side,
		or if we should make the decision server-side for "fairness"

/ Mario-Party-like race concept
	- Touching each checkpoint sets it as the spawn area
		chk -> latch -> (latch, previous latch, suppressor (XNOR), knife(2) -> previous suppressor)
		suppressor -> all spawners in this zone
	- Each stage has 4x6(?) grid of boxes, which *may* contain a platform
	- Difficult narrow path is always available, so there's less constraints on the random gen
	- Checkpoints raise the upcoming platforms, on a timer
		chk -> chk -> inv -> (timer -> raise, timer2(3) -> chk)
	- Exit TP is lower, so you can't be swept into it
	- Victory zone has clear floor, so you can watch their misfortune
	- Accel Wall of Doom reaches to the bottom of the Victory floor, so there's no escape for mortals
	- Successive stages might be lowered slightly (starting with the checkpoint), so it's easier to see from behind

. Modular procedural levels!
- Move proc gen to C, so it's less awful
- step climbing? Or some other trick to deal with the resulting lips??
- Big Crane
	- Doors (crane hand base) go limp when signaled

Okay, we're well on our way!
We've got
a probably-working physics engine
some basic Allegro thrown in


-Mess around / basic level design
-Enemies, which entail the following objects:
	optons
		This was a dumb earlier idea, shooting out blocks to see stuff is pointlessly expensive.
		Better just to raytrace to potential targets every so often, since we have raytracing stuff now
	bullets
	guns?
	A slightly different build function for enemies, so they release optons and respond appropriately
-More level design
-Menu level, which entails another object:
	level warp blocks
-What's this, more level design?
