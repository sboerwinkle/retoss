## Under Construction

This is like [Bittoss](https://github.com/sboerwinkle/bittoss), if you stripped out everything that was actually fun.

What's left is maybe... something like a game engine? That's too strong a word, but it's foundational stuff I don't want to rebuild, and should still suit my needs.

### What are "my needs"?

It's secret! Which means I've got vague goals, but at this point it probably won't come to anything, statistically
